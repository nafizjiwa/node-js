I am using Hyper terminal to communicate not the command line (which can also be used).
First - type npm init then terminal will ask a few question (THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR ANSWERS IN BRACKETS, THESE DEFAULT ARE GREAT TO USE)
      - Questions that should have answers and not bypassed by pressing return are:   
              - package name, version, description, and author
              - all other questions just return for default answers.
Second - press return when asked is this okay after you have check everything is in order ortherwise type no. (yes)

NOTE* This is all done in the new file and new folder you created for this new project...the new npm package created while you are in this new folder.
